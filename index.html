            My name is David Joyce. I am orginally from North Carolina. I grew
            up in Faytteville, NC and received my undergraduate degree from The
            University of North Carolina at Wilmington. Upon graduation I moved
            to the Raleigh area and obtained my Paralegal Certificate from
            Meredith College. I worked as a Paralegal for several years with
            Womble Bond Dickinson but have since transitioned into a new role as
            a crisis management coordinator, usually working with catostrophic
            accidents such as chemical spills, fires/explosions and high-profile
            bet the company type litigation.

            In my free time I enjoy the local craft beer scene that North
            Carolina is rapidly becoming famous for. I also enjoy fishing of any
            kind, duck hunting and College basketball. I have a puppy named
            Jezebel that is spoiled rotten. We usually go for walks after work
            and stop in a bottle shop and enjoy a beer after work.

            Currently, I am enrolled in the UNC Coding Bootcamp. Upon completion
            of the program in April of 2019, I am hoping to obtain a junior
            level programmer position. I am also interested in project
            management and would eventually like to transition into a task
            manager or junior project management position.
