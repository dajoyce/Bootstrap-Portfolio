            My name is David Joyce. I am orginally from North Carolina. I grew up in Faytteville, NC and received my
            undergraduate degree from The University of North Carolina at Wilmington. Upon graduation I moved to the
            Raleigh area and obtained my Paralegal Certificate from Meredith College. During the last thirteen years I
            have worked primarily in the Products Liability Division at Womble Bond Dickinson (US), LLP with a primary
            emphasis on Catastrophic Accidents and Mass Tort Litigation.

            I have recently completed the UNC Full-Stack Web Development Program and I am currently enrolled in the
            Project Management Institute's CAPM program. I am looking to pivot to a new career in software development
            and project management.
          </p>

            In my free time I enjoy spending time with my puppy, Jezebel, and the local craft beer scene that North
            Carolina is rapidly becoming famous for. I also enjoy fishing of any kind, duck hunting and College
            basketball and football.
