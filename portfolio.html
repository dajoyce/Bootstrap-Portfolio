              Proof was to demonstrate our groups use of handlebars and APIs. It allows the user to search different
              brands, recipes and locations for enjoying a refreshing cocktail. We were unable to find suitable APIs to
              use for this project so we pre-populated the databases and incorporated crowd sourcing to expand the
              databases. Proof is for the people and by the people!
